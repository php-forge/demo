    <h3>What is Yii ?</h3>

    <p>
        Yii is a high performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications. The name
        Yii (pronounced Yee or [ji:]) means "simple and evolutionary" in Chinese. It can also be thought of as an acronym
        for Yes It Is!
    </p>

    <h3 class='mt-3'>What is Yii Best for ?</h3>

    <p>
        Yii is a generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web applications
        using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching support, it is especially suitable
        for developing large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects,
        RESTful Web services, and so on.
    </p>
